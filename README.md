# Radropi - Asteroid and Meteor Detection System

## Project Description

the project aims to detect asteroids and meteor movement using high-quality cameras and radar detection methods using an AI model for accurate analysis, and it classifies bodies be in three categories: non-meteor, meteor, and asteroid. It also has software for detecting the shape and size of meteors.It consists of two systems: a solar power monitoring system and an asteroid monitoring system.


### Classification Categories

The AI model classifies detected objects into three categories:
- **Non-meteor**: Background objects, aircraft, satellites
- **Meteor**: Burning debris entering Earth's atmosphere
- **Asteroid**: Larger rocky bodies in space

## Hardware Components

### Main Processing Unit
- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB) - High-performance computing platform

### Detection Equipment
- IMX462 Starvis All-Sky Camera - Outstanding low-light performance
- Compact Automatic Satellite Dish - Auto-tracking capabilities
- Ublox NEO-6M GPS Module - Precise positioning

### Mechanical Components
- 4x MG995 Servo Motors - Robust tracking mechanisms
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) - Environmental sensing
