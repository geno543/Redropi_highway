# Radropi Development Journal

**Total Time Spent: 18.5 hours**

## Project Idea and Motivation

The idea for Radropi came from my fascination with space and the growing concern about near-Earth objects. After reading about recent asteroid discoveries and meteor events, I realized there was a gap in accessible detection systems for amateur astronomers and educational institutions. Most existing systems are either too expensive or too complex for widespread deployment.
